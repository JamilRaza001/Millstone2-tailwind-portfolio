              A multifaceted professional with a diverse skill
              set that encompasses web development, e-commerce, graphic design,
              and customer service. With experience in both technical and
              client-facing roles, I adopt a comprehensive approach to every
              project I engage in. I excel in WordPress web development, social
              media management, and crafting captivating visual content using
              tools like Canva and CapCut. My technical proficiency includes
              building modern web applications with Next.js, where I creatively
              apply custom CSS for styling, allowing for flexibility and
              innovation in design. In addition to my development skills, I
              possess a solid background in customer service from my tenure at
              HBL and my role as a Customer Service Agent. My practical
              experience in managing online stores has enhanced my ability to
              understand user needs and ensure a smooth online experience. At
              present, I am actively broadening my expertise by delving into
              Generative AI and Data Science. I am concentrating on data
              analysis, data wrangling, and visualization using tools such as
              Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. I am driven to extract
              actionable insights from data to optimize processes and enhance
              decision-making. Fueled by curiosity and a commitment to
              continuous learning, I consistently seek out new
              challengesâ€”whether that involves mastering advanced web
              technologies, improving customer experiences, or exploring
              innovative applications of AI and data science. I invite you to
              explore my portfolio, where you can see how I integrate
              creativity, technology, and data-driven insights to deliver
              effective and forward-thinking solutions
